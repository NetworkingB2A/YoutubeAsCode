Define and understand your goal
    just starting to write code doesnt work for me

I dont know where to start, it seems like so much at first
    start at the very beginning.
    import the first module you need and deliver on the absolute bare minimum. Then start to add new features. 

I am worried i may need to refactor my code.
    yeah, that will happen sometimes.
    but every time you realize that you need to refactor you code is just one pitfall you will avoid next time.

Stop starting and start finishing.

choose a coding standard and stick to it
